# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

This was a tough question when i think about it mathematically, because i wanted to find if there was any formula available for the sequence of even fibonacci numbers, but i didn't get any, although i will be searching for it, and once i find it, i will be update about it.

Now this problem can be easily solved by simple programming concepts, that is by using loops and a bit of logic.

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...` these are the `Fibonacci Numbers` and from this we need to find sum of all the `Even Fibonacci Numbers` without exceeding the given constraint `n`.

The `index.js` contains the code, change the `n` variable to provide a limit.
